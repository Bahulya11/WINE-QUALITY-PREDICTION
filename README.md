## Description:
_The focus is on predicting the quality of wine based on its chemical characteristics, offering a real-world application of machine learning in the context of viticulture. The dataset encompasses diverse chemical attributes, including density and acidity, which serve as the features for three distinct classifier models._

## KEY CONCEPTS AND CHALLENGES:
1. Classifier Models: Utilizing Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) for wine quality prediction.
2. Chemical Qualities: Analyzing features like density and acidity as predictors for wine quality.
3. Data Analysis Libraries: Employing Pandas for data manipulation and Numpy for array operations.
4. Data Visualization: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizing patterns and insights in the dataset.


## KEY SKILLS USED: _PYTHON, DATA ANALYSIS,MACHINE LEARNING, DATA VISUALIZATION, DATA PREPROCESSING._
